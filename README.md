# shortcoderlets

JSON export from the Shortcoder plugin (https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcoder/) I wish to use across my multisites. The plugin does not afford saving these shortcodes across a WP multisite so this repo is canonical.

I have no idea why the plugin exports/imports as .txt.

Also, when exported a "0" is added to end of the file that causes imports to fail. This is fixed before committing here.
